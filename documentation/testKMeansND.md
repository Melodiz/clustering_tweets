# Documentation for TestKMeansND.hpp

The `TestKMeansND.hpp` file is an integral part of the testing framework designed to validate the functionality and correctness of the KMeansND clustering algorithm implementation. This documentation provides an overview of the test cases included in `TestKMeansND.hpp`, detailing their purpose, methodology, test inputs, and expected outputs.

## Overview

`TestKMeansND` is a class that encapsulates a series of unit tests for the `KMeansND` class, which implements the K-Means clustering algorithm for N-dimensional data points. The tests cover various aspects of the algorithm, including initialization, clustering correctness, centroid calculation, and handling of edge cases.

## Test Methods

### `testInitialization2D()`

**Purpose:** Ensures that the `KMeansND` class correctly initializes with a given set of 2D points and assigns initial centroids.

**Test Input:** A vector of 10 predefined 2D points.

**Expected Output:** The test verifies that two centroids are initialized and are different from each other. It also checks that all points are correctly assigned to the `KMeansND` instance.

### `testCoordsResetBug2D()`

**Purpose:** Checks for a specific bug where point coordinates might be incorrectly reset or altered during clustering iterations.

**Test Input:** A vector of 10 predefined 2D points, identical to the one used in `testInitialization2D()`.

**Expected Output:** After several iterations of clustering, the test ensures that the original coordinates of the points remain unchanged, indicating that the bug is not present.

### `testClustering2D()`

**Purpose:** Validates the clustering logic by ensuring that points are correctly assigned to clusters based on their proximity to centroids.

**Test Input:** A vector of 10 predefined 2D points.

**Expected Output:** The test assumes expected cluster IDs for each point and verifies that the `KMeansND` clustering result matches these expectations.

### `testCentroidCalculation2D()`

**Purpose:** Tests the accuracy of centroid recalculation after each clustering iteration.

**Test Input:** A vector of 10 predefined 2D points.

**Expected Output:** The test calculates expected centroids based on the input points and compares them with the centroids calculated by `KMeansND`, ensuring they are within an acceptable margin of error.

### `testInitialization3D()`

**Purpose:** Similar to `testInitialization2D()`, but for 3D points, ensuring that the `KMeansND` class can handle points in three-dimensional space.

**Test Input:** A vector of 10 predefined 3D points.

**Expected Output:** Verifies that two centroids are initialized and distinct, and all points are correctly assigned to the `KMeansND` instance.

## Additional Tests

The documentation also mentions tests for more complex scenarios and edge cases, such as `testCoordsResetBug3D()`, `testClustering3D()`, and `testCentroidCalculation3DComplex()`. These tests follow a similar structure to their 2D counterparts but are designed to validate the algorithm's performance in three-dimensional space and more complex data distributions.

## Conclusion

The `TestKMeansND.hpp` file provides a comprehensive suite of unit tests that ensure the `KMeansND` class functions correctly across a variety of scenarios. By meticulously testing initialization, clustering, and centroid calculation logic, the tests help maintain the reliability and accuracy of the K-Means clustering implementation.
