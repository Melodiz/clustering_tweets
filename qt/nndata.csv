1661990368.0,"Yeah but what the above commenter is saying is their base doesnâ€™t want any of that. They detest all of those things, even the small gradual changes. Investing in nuclear energy is a tacit acknowledgement of man made climate change. Any acknowledgement or concession and they will be primaried out in a minute",0.5719,2.0
1661990340.0,"Any comparison of efficiency between solar and fossil fuels is nonsensical at best and intentionally misleading at worst. In no universe is light -&gt; photovoltaic cell -&gt; electricity less efficient than light -&gt; entire food chain -&gt; biomass -&gt; decomposition -&gt; millions of years of geothermal heat and pressure -&gt; extraction -&gt; refining and transport -&gt; burning -&gt; turbine generator -&gt; electricity.

Ugly? More ugly than power lines, roads, apartment buildings, tractors, fences, etc etc etc? You're simply not used to it. Also, who cares? Sure, millions of people died in the displacement from sea rise, famines cause by climate change, and wars from resource scarcity, but thank God we didn't have to look at those solar panels occasionally.

Offshore fracking? Fucks sake. Have you already forgotten the deepwater horizon disaster? Think about the damage that did to the gulf coast, add a few million barrels of highly toxic fracking fluid to the mix, and there you have our next major environmental disaster courtesy of offshore fracking. But oh man, those solar panels sure are ugly.

Stop repeating the lies fed to you by the people getting rich from fossil fuels, who couldn't care less about you or your descendants as long as they get theirs. We can deal with the less environmentally friendly aspects of solar power. We cannot deal with the consequences of continuing to pump carbon into the atmosphere. Y'all need to grow the fuck up and stop whining about the view.",-0.9877,2.0
1661990327.0,"I'm honestly waiting for climate change and the impacts of that to kick some fucking sense into people. But who am I kidding itll still just be more of the poor suffering while the rich claim victim hood for handouts while letting us all starve. Its honestly hard some days to not just give up, and I truly wonder if and when anything will ever actually be done.",-0.1143,1.0

1661990206.0,"I think climate change tends to get some people riled up. 

When I was part of a debate club, they loved throwing that subject in. One case we had to discuss was whether or not it was okay to fly if it pollutes the air. A friend of mine on the team got very worked up because he loves to travel. At the end, we actually had to make up because our disagreement about flying got very heated.",0.6634,1.0
1661990120.0,Naaa how could anyone be mad at a face like that... Must definitely be climate change,0.25,1.0
1661990114.0,"Can i suggest maybe honing in on LGBTQ?

It's a useful grab-bag for talking about issues like law reform and workplace discrimination, but less so as you dive into addressing people's stated needs.  Literally 95% of my congregation voted for marriage equality a couple of years ago, and we were active in the push for the ordination of people in same gender relationships.

Meanwhile there's been significant pushback on the church council's idea to include our preferred pronouns in our written communications as a matter of course, so I'll be spending this afternoon trying to begin a pathway to a respectful conversation between those who think the move is a no-brainer and those who think it's a no-brainer that gender is fixed and requires no discussion.

**Edit**: Also, great list... really interesting discussions... I wonder about Health Care and Climate Change as other additions?",0.9779,2.0
1661990065.0,"They need to change laws so it's more worth selling agriculture products in the US rather than export it.  They also need to change laws so there are monetary penalties for growing crops that are not particularly viable to an area's natural climate.  As it stands right now, my neighbor makes double the price per head of cattle by exporting out of country than he would selling right here.  All the people complaining about climate change on here should probably be complaining about this too.",0.469,2.0
1661990023.0,"Just thought I would share the climatological data for the pok area for those nervous about the drought:

[https://www.weather.gov/wrh/Climate?wfo=aly](https://www.weather.gov/wrh/Climate?wfo=aly)

*(Pick Poughkeepsie Area- Monthly summarized data- 2000-2022, Precipitation, Sum and press go)*

You'll see that July and August are set to be record low rainfall since 2000, and although if we keep breaking low records it would be very bad- you can see what a little tropical moisture can do to the numbers... check out a few of those max numbers in Sept, Oct, and Nov.

And even if we break the 2001 year total low record- check out all the numbers since 2000...

In the HV we are lucky that multi and contiguous years of record low rainfall are very rare.

Now that's not to say we should go out and use water like crazy- conservation is warranted- always and very much so right now IMHO.  I also understand climate change will continually affect weather patterns and like stocks- past performance does not indicate future results necessarily...

BUT for those getting seriously anxious, don't panic.  Look at the climatology data linked above, and I think it will make you feel better.

And as an FYI- the next drought update from the National Weather Service is expected on Sept 13th.",0.7367,3.0
1661990019.0,"Blaming environmentalists for the failure of nuclear energy world wide is just such a weird take, when did governments/companies ever give a fuck about their opinion? Never as seen by the small problem of climate change that we have now. But what do they care about? MONEY! 

Nuclear energy was never cheap like the industry promised in the 70s. In the past it wasn't competitive against fossil fuels and now it isn't against renewables.",0.3094,4.0
